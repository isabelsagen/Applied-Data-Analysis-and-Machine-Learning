# Regression analysis and resampling methods for prognosticate terrain data
Welcome to our computational exploration of terrain data prediction, where we employ various regression techniques including ordinary least squares (OLS), Ridge, and LASSO regression. This is done using the Franke function and real life terrain data from Norway. Our objective is to evaluate the performance of these models and determine which one provides the most accurate fit to real-world data.

## Code structure üñ•

To run and visualise the regression we run the main.py code. The code written here is only declearing and visualisation the regression results. Here the sections tells what we are visualising, and to run remember to remove the comments. For the regressions and creation of data we are using the Linear_Reagression class written in myutils.py. Here we have all the methods to run the regressions. 

In main.py there are lots of parameters you can change, those are made clear in the code :)


### Run main.py üèóüì≤
To run the code make sure to use Python 3. We must include the terrain data file denoted as SRTM_data_Norway_1.tif to run the code. For running the Python script from main_p1 write:

```
python3 main.py
```

where the path coincides with where we have our Python script file on our computer. An example path is:

``/Documents/FYS-STK4155/Project1/main_p1``

We hope you have a good time exploring our regressions! <3
